It included a username/password login, poll creation tools tied into IMDb's public API, and polls enriched with IMDb data. Users could submit a comment with their vote. The front page displayed six randomly-chosen polls, with the movie poster of one of its randomly-chosen options. Users each had a profile page, which showed all their created quizzes and all their submitted comments.",
